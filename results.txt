# POST-IRMA RESILIENCE PROJECT PRIORITIZATION AND PLANNING

## BANGLADESH EXTREME TEMPERATURE EVENTS RESPONSE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on the historical data showing recurring extreme temperature events in Bangladesh (2007, 2009, 2012), I'm developing a comprehensive resilience framework for regions affected by extreme temperature disasters. The affected areas include Maulvibazar (Sylhet Division) and Jaldhaka (Rangpur Division), representing both northeastern and northern vulnerable zones.

## WEEK 1: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND ASSESSMENT PHASE (Days 1-7)

### Day 1-2: Rapid Assessment and Emergency Response

#### Priority Actions:

1. **Life-Safety Assessment**

   * Deploy rapid assessment teams to Maulvibazar and Jaldhaka
   * Establish casualty counts and medical needs
   * Identify vulnerable populations (elderly, children, pregnant women)
   * Map heat-related illness cases

2. **Emergency Cooling Centers**

   * Commandeer existing structures: schools, community centers, mosques
   * Target locations:

     * Maulvibazar town center (24.4807°N, 91.9152°E)
     * Jaldhaka upazila headquarters (26.0295°N, 88.9934°E)
   * Equipment needed per center:

     * Portable generators (5–10 kW)
     * Industrial fans (10+ per location)
     * Water storage tanks (5,000 L)
     * Basic medical supplies

3. **Water Distribution Network**

   * Establish 15–20 water distribution points per district
   * Deploy water tankers (5,000–10,000 L)
   * Coordinate with tube well operators
   * Distribute WHO-approved purification tablets

#### Resource Requirements (Week 1):

* **Personnel**: 50–75 per district
* **Vehicles**: 10–15 water tankers, 5–7 ambulances
* **Budget**: $150,000–200,000
* **Medical supplies**: 50,000 ORS units, basic meds

#### Transportation Strategy:

* **Primary routes**:

  * Dhaka → Sylhet → Maulvibazar (via N2, ~200 km)
  * Dhaka → Rangpur → Jaldhaka (via N5, ~350 km)
* **Challenges**: monsoon road conditions
* **Mitigation**: pre-position supplies

### Day 3–4: Infrastructure Assessment

#### Critical Infrastructure Survey:

1. **Health Facilities**
2. **Power Infrastructure**
3. **Water Systems**
4. **Agricultural Impact**

#### Assessment Teams:

* Team A (Health): 1 doctor, 2 nurses, 1 data collector
* Team B (Infrastructure): 1 engineer, 1 electrician, 1 water specialist
* Team C (Agriculture): 1 ag officer, 1 vet, 1 surveyor
* **Total**: 18 teams (3 sets × 2 districts × 3 categories)

---

### Day 5–7: Immediate Resilience Measures

#### Quick-Impact Projects:

1. **Community Cooling Infrastructure** – $12,000–20,000
2. **Emergency Water Point Upgrades** – $12,000–30,000
3. **Health Post Strengthening** – $25,000–35,000
4. **Early Warning System Setup** – $15,000–20,000
